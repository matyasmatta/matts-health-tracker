I never coded anything in Kotlin. Okay, maybe when I was like twelve and my new friend from summer camp taught me how to work with Android Studio. Back then you had that layout builder which did not need any coding skill so I just made layouts. Maybe I'm a better coder now, but more likely it's been all ChatGPT's work. I just give it the instructions and with basic coding knowledge know where to paste and how to fix some dependencies. You know, you need to understand the concept of a _variable_, maybe? Anyways, Kotlin! Yeah! What an interesting Java derivative.
